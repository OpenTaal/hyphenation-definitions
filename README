This repository is used to draft an IETF RFC open standard in which a format for hyphenation definitions is described. Hyphenations definitions can be processed to generate hyphenation patterns which are used by a manifold of text processing software such as typesetting programs, office suites, graphic editors, web browsers, content management systems and much more.

This repository contains an XML file with the draft RFC. Exports to plain text and HTML were made with the Makefile which calls xml2rfc, http://xml.resource.org
