Title
-----
A standard for prioritised and dynamic hyphenation definitions

Abstract
--------
This presentation describes a standard for hyphenation definitions enabling the generation of prioritised and dynamic hyphenation patterns.

In the early nineteen-eighties, automatic hyphenation of lexical items has been made possible by a hyphenator using language-specific hyphenation patterns. These patterns are generated by the hyphenation software community from hyphenated word lists.

The initial design was based on the English orthography and limited character encoding. Support for extended encodings was added in the 1990s mostly for Western languages. However, the hyphenated word list format remained rather unchanged. This complicated the support of specific morphological or phonological structures, requiring hyphenation priority in compounds or dynamic hyphenation resulting in altered spelling.

Although over 70 languages are supported now, hyphenation is suboptimal and impossible for languages relying on a universal character encoding. This limited method of hyphenation has been catering to digital typesetting over three decades. Unfortunately, recently implemented hyphenation in layout engines for web page rendering is built upon the same outdated technology.

An improved hyphenator and extended hyphenation patterns are necessary to overcome current limitations and support a wider range of languages. To achieve this, the software community needs a standard format for hyphenation definitions in universal human-readable hyphenated word lists. A context-free grammar was developed with unambiguous and fine-grained control allowing enhanced hyphenation. All language-specific cases are illustrated with examples and lexicological theory.

Our standard for hyphenation definitions enables improved automatic hyphenation for printed media and web documents.
